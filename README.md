# SoPra FS23 Group 40 - TacBlock

## Introduction
### Motivation
Our idea was to create a game that would be fun to play, which keeps us motivated for the whole semester.
We decided to create "TacBlock", which is similar as the original game ["Blokus" from Bernard Tavitian](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus), but as a nice online game version.

### Game Mechanism
The game is played by 4 players, who have to place their blocks on the board. The goal is to place as many blocks as possible. The game ends when no player can place any more blocks on the board. The winner is the player with the most blocks on the board.
You can find a "Rules" section in the game, which explains the game in more detail.

## Technologies
- We use **JavaScript** as the main programming Language for the Client.
- With **REST**, the Client can interact with the Server.
- We use **React** as the main framework for the Client.
- With **SCSS**, we do the styling.
- The Client is built with **npm**.
- Both Client and Server are deployed on **Google Cloud** and the code is stored **GitHub**.
- **SonarCloud** checks our code every time we push to GitHub and deploy it.

_For the Server's technologies, please refer to the Client's README.md._

## High-level components
- [Game](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Client/blob/8f227414681f2075cfc79b761a732c516880c0fc/src/components/views/Game.js) for the whole game View and its logic which allows users to actually play the game
- [Lobby](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Client/blob/8f227414681f2075cfc79b761a732c516880c0fc/src/components/views/Lobby.js) for the lobby logic View which allows users to create and join lobbies
- [Overview](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Client/blob/8f227414681f2075cfc79b761a732c516880c0fc/src/components/views/Overview.js) is the view which lists all open lobbies and lets users create new ones
- [AppRouter](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-40/Client/blob/8f227414681f2075cfc79b761a732c516880c0fc/src/components/routing/routers/AppRouter.js) is the main router which handles all the routing in the application

## Launch & Deployment
### How to run the application
1. Clone the repository and navigate in the terminal to its location
2. With the command `npm install`, you install all dependencies.
3. Using `npm run dev`, you start and run the application.
4. The application is now running on localhost:3000.
5. To run only the tests, use the command `npm run test`.

### How to deploy the application
1. To deploy the application, push it to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
2. The application will be automatically deployed on Google Cloud and checked by SonarCloud.
3. The Client is now deployed on http://sopra-fs23-group-40-client.oa.r.appspot.com.<br>
   _(the Server will be deployed on http://sopra-fs23-group-40-server.oa.r.appspot.com)_

_Please note that Google Cloud checks are very strict.
It is possible that the deployment fails for example because of unused import statements,
so make sure to chat that beforehand._
